## New York City Steps Up To The Plate

Long before the COVID-19 pandemic, we faced a mental health crisis in this country. Millions of Americans experience mental illness, substance misuse, and daily struggles with anxiety or depression — yet the appropriate care has not been there when they need it. But we have never had a comprehensive federal strategy to guarantee mental health care to every American. The challenge has fallen on cities, states, and localities to care for their people.

New York City met this challenge – bringing more mental health support to New Yorkers than ever before. Key milestones:<p>

<div class="list-unordered--check">

* 2015: We launched the groundbreaking ThriveNYC, a decisive turning point in the way New York City approaches mental health and substance misuse. ThriveNYC is the most comprehensive mental health roadmap of any city or state in the nation. ThriveNYC programs are implemented by more than a dozen City agencies and nearly 200 non-profit partners.

* 2016: We launched NYC Well, a ThriveNYC program and a crisis information and referral helpline that provides no-cost, 24/7 mental health support to New Yorkers in more than 200 languages. More than one million New Yorkers have received immediate support from NYC Well counselors and peer specialists, as well as referrals to ongoing care.

* 2019: We launched NYC Care, guaranteeing quality, affordable access to health care, including mental health care, to New Yorkers regardless of their immigration status or ability to pay. The program expanded to all five boroughs in 2020.

* 2019: We expanded Social & Emotional Learning and Restorative Justice to all public schools Citywide. Today, every child in our public schools is taught to process their emotions in the same way they learn to read or multiply – and learns the skills to interact with peers, friends, and family in a healthy way.

## 2021 and Beyond: Going Even Further through Mental Health for All

We are now doubling down on this foundation by:

<div class="list-unordered--check">

* Creating the Mayor’s Office of Community Mental Health. We have created a new mayoral office, dedicated to mental health, as a permanent fixture in City government – working across our schools, hospitals, homeless shelters, and beyond to deliver mental health support and services to every New Yorker

* New mental health teams to respond to moments of crisis: We announced that, for the first time in New York City’s history, mental health and medical experts will now be part of the response to 911 mental health calls, beginning in three high-need communities.

* Expanding NYC Care citywide: We delivered on our promise to guarantee health care access to all New Yorkers citywide, launching NYC Care in Manhattan and Queens ahead of schedule to reach all five boroughs.

* Creating COVID-19 Centers of Excellence: We opened two Centers in hard-hit communities across the City to bring comprehensive short- and long-term care to New Yorkers recovering from COVID-19, including mental health support, with a third Center on the way.

* Expanding Social, Emotional, and Academic behavioral screenings in schools: We announced check-ins for all New York City public school students as they return to the classroom – helping our educators better understand their needs and well-being.
