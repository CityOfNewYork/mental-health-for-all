In this report, you will see the comprehensive mental health support provided to every New Yorker – broken into five groups that we are focused on as we recover from COVID-19:

<div class="list-unordered--check">

1. **Our students and young people**. The past year has profoundly affected our children who have been subject to isolation, different forms of learning, and loss in their families and communities. 

1. **Our communities of color**. COVID-19 didn’t create inequities in mental health care – it revealed and exacerbated them. We will continue to bring additional resources to communities that have been underserved for decades. 

1. **New Yorkers who want or need help for substance misuse**. The opioid crisis hasn’t gone away – and substance misuse has, for many, get worse during COVID-19. 

1. **New Yorkers with serious mental illness (SMI)**. The COVID-19 pandemic has made it more difficult to stay connected to care. New initiatives help avert crises and provide long-term care that promotes real stability in people’s lives. 

1. **Every New Yorker who needs help**. Everyone has been affected in some way by this past year, and our mission is to go into our communities to ensure every person has the support they need.
