# MHFA

Work-in-progress.

## Contributing

As of right now this project should be relative to the Growing Up Patterns.

```
- üìÅ growingupnyc-patterns
- üìÅ mhfa
```

If you do not have the [Growing Up NYC Patterns](https://github.com/NYCOpportunity/growingupnyc-patterns) set up this way, clone them before cloning this package.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/NYCOpportunity/growingupnyc-patterns
$ git clone https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/mhfa
$ cd mhfa
```

Then install dependencies and start the [Patterns CLI](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/patterns-cli) development server.

```shell
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## CHANGELOG

### v0.0.0-1

Initialized an NPM/Node.js project.

```
$ npm init
```

Installed the @NYCOpportunity [Patterns CLI](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/patterns-cli) and [Growing Up NYC Patterns](https://github.com/NYCOpportunity/growingupnyc-patterns).

```shell
$ npm install @nycopportunity/pttrn
```

The **Growing Up NYC Patterns** need to be installed as a local file dependency.

```
$ cd ../
$ git clone https://github.com/NYCOpportunity/growingupnyc-patterns
$ cd mhfa
$ npm install ../growingupnyc-patterns
```

The path **../growingupnyc-patterns** would vary if Growing Up Patterns is already cloned locally.

Ran the [pttrn scaffold command](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/patterns-cli/#scaffold) to set up the project.

```shell
$ npx pttrn scaffold
```

Added [Pattern NPM scripts](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/patterns-cli/#npm-scripts) to the project.

```json
  "scripts": {
    "start": "cross-env NODE_ENV=development concurrently \"pttrn -w\" \"pttrn serve -w\" -p \"none\"",
    "version": "npm run default && git add .",
    "prepublishOnly": "git push && git push --tags",
    "publish": "cross-env NODE_ENV=production pttrn publish",
    "default": "cross-env NODE_ENV=production pttrn"
  },
```

Added **.gitignore** to the project.

```shell
$ touch .gitignore
```

Updated README.md
