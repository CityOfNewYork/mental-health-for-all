          <p>Anyone who is experiencing a mental health crisis can reach out to NYC Well to consider a mobile crisis team.</p>

          <p>Mobile crisis teams are groups of health professionals, such as nurses, social workers, and psychiatrists, who can provide mental health services in your home.</p>

          <p>Depending on what a person is willing to accept, the teams may offer a range of services during and immediately following a crisis, including:</p>

          <div class="list-unordered--check">
            <ul>
              <li>Assessment</li>

              <li>Crisis intervention</li>

              <li>Supportive counseling</li>

              <li>Information and referrals, including to community-based mental health services</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <p>If a mobile crisis team determines that a person in crisis needs further psychiatric or medical assessment, they can transport that person to a hospital psychiatric emergency room.</p>

          <p>Mobile crisis teams may direct police to take a person to an emergency room against their will only if they have a mental illness (or the appearance of mental illness) and are a danger to themselves or others. This is under the NYS Mental Hygiene Law.</p>
